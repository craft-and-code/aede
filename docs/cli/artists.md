# artists — List artists in the catalog

artists lists the local artists and counts/durations of their catalogued participation. --role filters credits, --query projects a track expression onto artists and --country uses fetched MusicBrainz origin, not a guessed tag. Fetch artist data first for origins; run countries to see available names. Sort by name/title, tracks, albums, duration/length or size.

This plural command takes no positional entity name. Use the singular/detail command to open one item rather than appending a name to the list. The displayed order is deterministic. Where pagination is offered, --offset counts skipped rows from zero, --limit must be positive and --all cannot be combined with --limit. CSV/JSON exports contain the filtered, paged result shown, not automatically the whole library. Add --all when supported for a complete export. The listing is read-only.

## Syntax and arguments

```text
aede artists
```

No positional arguments. Use the filters listed below.

## Options for this command

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--csv` | Write a CSV table of this command’s result, suitable for a spreadsheet; mutually exclusive with other output formats. |
| `--output FILE / -o FILE` | Write an export to FILE instead of standard output. A selection needs --csv, --json or --m3u; command-specific exports have their own rules. |
| `--role ROLE` | Keep the people or contributions with this credit role; on credit, specify the new role. |
| `--country NAME` | Filter by MusicBrainz country/area name, not a country code or inferred tag. Fetch artist data first. |
| `--limit N` | Show at most N rows; use a positive whole number. Default limits depend on the page, usually 50. |
| `--offset N` | Skip N rows before showing the result; N starts at 0. Ordering remains deterministic. |
| `--all` | Show every row. Refused with --limit. Some commands also use it to include normally hidden categories, explained below. |
| `--json / -j` | Write this command’s structured JSON result. With analyze, save report files instead of changing terminal output. |
| `--separator ";" / --separator tab` | With --csv only: use comma by default, a one-character separator such as ;, or tab for tab-separated text. Quote ; in a shell. |
| `--sort ORDER` | Choose a supported column; append - for descending order, for example duration-. Supported values for this command are listed below. |
| `--query EXPRESSION` | Pass a relational query expression. Its projection depends on the command: save it, select tracks or retain matching albums/artists. |

The shared [options reference](options.md) explains `--data`, `--no-color`, `--help`/`-h`, `--version`/`-v`/`-V`, option values and output/pagination rules. These shared presentation/data options do not make every command support CSV/JSON or pagination.

## Examples

```sh
aede artists --limit 20
aede artists --country France --all
aede artists --role producer
aede artists --query "loved"
```

## Result and errors

Output describes the selected operation or catalog data. Read any per-item warnings and retained-work summary; a completed process is not an independent integrity or audio-quality guarantee. Invalid command syntax/options normally exit with code 2; handler failures normally exit with code 1. Local interruption differs from a delegated server task, as explained in [cancel](cancel.md).
